 **Duckietown is an open-source and community driven platform used for robotics research, education, and outreach.**


In its simplest form, Duckietown is a small-scale city where simple autonomous vehicles 
called Duckiebots, navigate the streets with the objective of collecting their Duckie 
passengers and depositing them at their desired location. Though we must say the Duckies can
be a little tight-lipped.

### What is Duckietown?

However, the brightly colored cities and charming Duckie-adorned robots are only the visual identity 
of a complex and sophisticated robotics education platform.

The goal of the **Duckietown platform** is to create an **_all-in-one tool_** to learn about autonomous driving.
Of what does our platform comprise?

* Instructions to make your own Duckietowns and Duckiebots
* Software to make your Duckiebots perform tasks autonomously
* Reference manual for introductory robotics
* Teaching modules, plans, and other guides for educators or self-learners

All neccessary information about our this platform is included in our 
(still under development and therefore not yet polished) [Duckiebook](book.duckietown.org).

### Current status of the project

The second **official** iteration of the class began in September 2017 and was 
taught cooperatively at three locations ([Zürich, Montréal, Chicago](classes/2017/index.html)). 
A project that started as a graduate class in 2016 has now grown to an [international](outreach.html) effort.
Upwards of 20 other universities have used the materials produced, as well as 
hundreds of self-guided learners.
 Duckietown has been adapted for both undergraduates and for high school students and has
  been used in hackathons and to demonstrate research principles.
 
 But this is only the beginning! Duckietown is still in its infancy and we want **you** 
 to **use** and **improve** our *ever-evolving* and *collaborative* 
education and research platform. Reach out to us if you are interested in [joining](contact.html)
 our quacky community.
